                <div class="problem-content">
                    <p>She reaches across the table, the last piece of mango balanced on her fork. There's a teasing glint in her eyes, and you realize she's savoring the moment, knowing exactly how it's affecting you. The mango glistens in the midday sun, its flesh golden and soft, a summer's crescendo distilled into one single piece.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Here," she says, offering it to you, but she doesn't quite hand it over. It hovers there, just out of reach.</p>
                    
                    <p>You roll your eyes, but there's a smile tugging at the corner of your mouth. "You're going to make me work for it?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Maybe." She shrugs, still holding it just beyond your reach. "Or maybe I just want to see how badly you want it."</p>
                    
                    <p>You lean forward, closing the space between you two, until your hand rests over hers, guiding the fork toward your mouth. The mango is soft and fragrant, its sweetness bursting onto your tongue like fireworks, so rich that it almost aches. She watches, a satisfied smile spreading across her face, and you wonder if it's the mango she's smiling about—or if it's you, tasting it for the first and last time.</p>
                    
                    <p>As you savor that final bite, she leans back, crossing her arms. "So," she says casually, "if we're all doomed and tomorrow really is the end, is there anything else you'd want to do?"</p>
                    
                    <p>The question catches you off guard, a tiny follow-up to her previous one, but it feels heavier somehow. You chew slowly, thinking. Would you want to travel? Say goodbye to everyone you know? Try to knock some final item off a bucket list? Strangely, nothing else comes to mind except this moment, this table, this simple act of sharing mango and small talk with her.</p>
                    
                    <p>"No," you finally answer. "I think I'd be right here."</p>
                    
                    <p>"Good," she says, the glint returning to her eyes, like she's already known what you'd say. "I'm glad you're not trying to drag us to some far-off cliff to watch the world end. Too much work."</p>
                    
                    <p>You laugh, the sound a little louder than you expect, and for a second, it's like you've forgotten the question. It's absurd to imagine such a thing—to care so deeply about where to be, what to say, if there's no future beyond tomorrow.</p>
                    
                    <p>She shifts, tucking her legs beneath her and resting her chin on her hand, studying you. "You know, we keep talking about the end like it's something we can control. But maybe it's really about how we fill up the time we have left. Even if it's just an afternoon."</p>
                    
                    <p>"Like with mango," you say, half-joking, as you gesture to the empty plate.</p>
                    
                    <p>She nods, her gaze softening. "Exactly. The last mango of the summer. Sweet, because it's fleeting."</p>
                    
                    <p>There's a quiet pause, and you let it settle between you. The world outside the patio feels distant now, as if you've entered some timeless space where only the two of you exist. The trees rustle in the breeze, and you find yourself memorizing the way her hair catches the light, the way the sun casts dappled shadows across her face. You wonder if she's thinking the same thing.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Can I tell you something?" she asks suddenly, breaking the silence.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Of course."</p>
                    
                    <p>"I'm terrified of endings," she admits, her voice barely above a whisper. "I know it sounds silly, but I always try to hold onto the last bit of something, even if it's just a mango, just to pretend it's not over yet."</p>
                    
                    <p>For a moment, you see her differently. You realize that her question about coming to see her if the world ended wasn't just a game. It was a way of asking whether she mattered enough to make you stop time, just for her.</p>
                    
                    <p>You reach across the table, covering her hand with yours. "Then maybe endings are our reminders to live fully, even if it's for a single bite of mango," you say, your thumb tracing gentle circles on the back of her hand.</p>
                    
                    <p>She closes her eyes for a second, breathing in, and you can almost hear her heart beat in time with yours.</p>
                    
                    <p>When she opens them, her gaze is steady, as if she's made peace with something in that single, small exchange. "Well," she says, finally releasing your hand, "that settles it then."</p>
                    
                    <p>"What does?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"That we're going to have the sweetest summer."</p>
